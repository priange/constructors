// Constructors and Class Assignment
// Question1
// You are working on a web application for a car rental company.
//  They want to keep track
// of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to
//  create a JavaScript class or
// function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and 
// another one for
// representing rental information.
// Requirements:
// 1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the 
// following properties:
// a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota".
// b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry".
// c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020.
// d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently 
// available for rent.
class Car{
   constructor(make,model,year,isAvailable){
    this.make=make;
    this.model=model;
    this.year=year;
    this.isAvailable=isAvailable;
    // this.toogleAvailable=toogleAvailable;
}
}
let car=new Car('Toyota','Camry',2020,true)
console.log(car)
console.log(car.isAvailable)
car.isAvailable=false
console.log(car.isAvailable)

// The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called
// toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its
//  opposite value (true to
// false, false to true)

// 2) Create a Rental class or function constructor that has the 
// following properties:
// ● car (Car object): The car that has been rented.
// ● renterName (string): The name of the person who rented the car.
// ● rentalStartDate (Date object): The start date of the rental period.
// ● rentalEndDate (Date object): The end date of the rental period.
// The Rental class or function constructor should also have a 
// method called
// calculateRentalDuration that returns the rental duration in days.
class Rental{
    constructor(car,rentalName,rentalStartDate,rentalEndDate,calculateRentalDuration){
        this.car=car;
        this.rentalName=rentalName;
        this.rentalStartDate=rentalStartDate;
        this.rentalEndDate=rentalEndDate;
        ;
    }

}
let rental=new Rental('{The car has been rented}','Ebiu','{12/07/2020}','{15/07/2020}')
console.log(rental)

// for(cal of calculateRentalDuration){
//     for (cal in calculateRentalDuration){
    
//     }
// }
// 3) Create an instance of the Car class or function constructor for 
// a car in the
// inventory. Then, create an instance of the Rental class or function 
// constructor for
// a rental involving the car you created. Finally, calculate the 
// rental duration using
// the calculateRentalDuration method.


// Question2
// You are building a simple quiz app that contains multiple-choice 
// questions. Your task is
// to create two JavaScript classes: Question and Quiz. The Question
//  class will represent
// individual questions, and the Quiz class will manage a collection
//  of questions and the
// user's progress.
// 1. Create a Question class with the following properties:
// ● text(string): The text of the question.
// ● options(array): An array containing the multiple-choice options.
// ● correctAnswer(string): The correct answer to the question.
// The Question class should also have a method called checkAnswer 
// that takes a
// user's answer as a parameter and returns true if the answer is 
// correct and false
// otherwise.
// 2. Create a Quiz class with the following properties:
// ● questions(array):An array of Question objects.
// ● currentQuestionIndex(number): The index of the current question 
// in the
// questions array.
// ● score(number): The user’s current score.
// The Quiz class should have the following methods:
// ● addQuestion: Takes a Question object as a parameter and adds 
// it to the
// questions array.
// ● nextQuestion: Advances to the next question in the quiz by
//  incrementing the
// currentQuestionIndex.
// ● submitAnswer: Takes a user's answer as a parameter, checks if 
// 
// the answer is
// correct using the checkAnswer method of the Question class,
//  and updates the
// score if the answer is correct.
